        <h2>1. What is Cobwebb?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb is an AI-powered chatbot that can answer your questions and provide helpful information relating to annual proxy statements from s&p 500 companies.
            Cobwebb is a work in progress, so be patient and generous with it, as of now. I'm making some significant improvements rapidly.</p>

        <h2>2. How does Cobwebb work?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand your queries and generate relevant responses.
            It retrieves information from a knowledge base and provides citations for the sources used. This type of architecture is known as Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG). More on this below.</p>

        <h2>3. What are these citations?</h2>
        <p>The citations tab shows you the data that informed the model's generated output. You won't need to pay too much attention to this, unless you're looking for something specific, or you want to search a proxy yourself with some copied text. It's just meant to provide some faith in the model's output.</p>

        <h2>4. What kind of questions can I ask?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb is meant to dig up specific information buried in proxies. Currently, it isn't great at generalizing across it's ENTIRE knowledge base, so questions like "tell me every company that payed out in __" won't be the best. You can still ask for examples of things, though.
            "Provide me with examples of __" is a great starting point. Of course, questions about specific companies are more likely to provide valuable insights.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Why RAG? How does it work?</h2>
        <p>Language models are bound by context windows. SOTA language models are great for answering questions about a single large document, but can't reason over an infite context window.
            RAG addresses this problem by injecting only the relevant information from a corpus of documents into the prompt for a generative language model. However, RAG is not an out-of-the-box-solution.
            For a use case such as this one, some customization is required to ensure the architecture returns the most relevant and accurate information, while minimizing hallucinations. More on RAG here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997
        </p>

        <h2>6.What's behind the curtain?</h2>
        <p> This application uses OpenAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" for embeddings, "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125" for query expansion, and "gpt-4-1106-preview" for generation. It uses Cohere's "rerank-english-v2.0" for better retreival, and is built on top of a Pinecone vector store. </p>

        <h2>7.How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p> For all of the resources mentioned above, there are associated costs. However, the only dynamic costs are the costs associated with adding more information to the application's knowledge base, and the costs of each user query.
            Currently, your average query should cost around 5-10 cents, subject to change and moderate variability. More on this to come. </p>
