        <h2>1. What is Cobwebb?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb is an AI-powered chatbot that can answer your questions and provide helpful information relating to annual proxy statements from s&p 500 companies. Cobwebb is a work in progress, so be patient and generous with it, as of now. I'm making some significant improvements rapidly.</p>

        <h2>2. How does Cobwebb work?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb uses advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand your queries and generate relevant responses. It retrieves information from a knowledge base and provides citations for the sources used.</p>

        <h2>3. What are these citations?</h2>
        <p>The citations tab shows you the data that informed the model's generated output. You won't need to pay too much attention to this, unless you're looking for something specific. It's just meant to provide some faith in the model's output.</p>

        <h2>4. What kind of questions can I ask?</h2>
        <p>Cobwebb is meant to dig up specific information buried in proxies. Currently, it isn't great at generalizing across it's ENTIRE knowledge base, so questions like "tell me every company that payed out in __" won't be the best. You can still ask for examples of things, though.
            "Provide me with examples of __" is a great starting point. Of course, questions about specific companies are more likely to provide valuable insights.
